HypnoLog-nodejs TODO list
===================================

- define some easy-to-use basic logging methods
- make it as a package/library
- handle when server is down
- push some code to github
- solve async issues (?) (logged data might appear in incorrect order)
- consider making it Javascript library for client side, and not only node
