HypnoLog NodeJS Library
============================

## What is HypnoLog?
*Get Hypnotized While Logging*

*HypnoLog* allows you to fast and easily visualize your application data/objects while debugging. From any environment, in any language. Forget about those black text-based console debug-printing back from the 70's. 

**See [HypnoLog main repo](https://github.com/SimonLdj/hypnolog-server).**
